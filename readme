The second half of project is the consumer , which in this case is a console application . here , the queue is consumed and console logging done for testing purpose.

Also , A docker compose file is used to spinup a docker image of RMQ . 

Significance : 

This is a design principal / architecture of Microservices communication.

for instance : An example i remember from YouTube. 
In mircoservice architecture , all the services are suppose to be individual elements that can be hosted on multiple muchine , interacting with different databases. 
In this scenario , if we want to initiate any additional step when the event occurs , then we need a means by which they can communicate with each other.

A laymans example would be , When a signup happens Automatically a welcome email is triggered to the user.
